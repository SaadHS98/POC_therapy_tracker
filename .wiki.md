# Project Summary
The Therapy Progress Tracking application enhances the therapeutic process by enabling therapists to track client progress through structured data analysis. It integrates advanced technologies to visualize symptom changes over time, facilitating improved treatment outcomes. The application incorporates standardized assessments like GAD-7 and PHQ-9 to ensure clinical validity while providing actionable insights for therapists. The project is now transitioning to a complete, deployable web application using Streamlit for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, making it suitable for storage on GitHub.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Frontend UI**: Built with Streamlit, it provides an interactive interface for therapists to upload session notes, view progress, and compare client sessions.
- **Backend API**: Developed using FastAPI, it processes uploaded data, performs analysis, and serves insights.
- **AI Processing**: Utilizes NLP and machine learning to extract symptoms, track progress, and generate insights from therapy notes.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of client progress, symptom changes, and assessment scores to aid therapist interpretation.
